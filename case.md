# Assignment Description

Please present a solution for the following problem:

You are working on a new social platform for LEGO fans where users can upload a picture and description of their NPU creation. NPU is a fan term that stands for Nice Part Usage, and it refers to a LEGO element being used in a new and unexpected way, yet it perfectly fits the overall build. The platform lets the users score others' creations based on creativity and uniqueness. They can also search for ideas and inspiration based on an element name among the uploaded NPU creations.

The new **NPU Backend 1.0â„¢** (trademark pending) is designed to be consumed on multiple platforms, both mobile and web. Design the architecture and implement the endpoint(s).

We do not expect a fully functioning application. It is ok to stub parts of the application to focus on other aspects that you think show off your skillset better.

The assignment creates a base of discussion for the interview. We do not expect you to use more than **10 hours** on the task.

**Tip:** Don't waste time on setting up a huge project from scratch. Find a suitable boilerplate and work from that.
